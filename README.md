# versioned-ui - A CMS Admin UI

## Backlog (Sprint)

* Support relationships in DataForm
  Need search for this?
  Check out contentful and others

* Show version history or changelog on the DataEdit page

* Same error message handling in DataForm as in ModelsForm

* Fetch and show relationships in DataList

* ModelsList
  * Move to homepage?

* Pagination for DataList

* Support JSON object field with schema?

* Make Data select last edited Model (via localStorage)?

* Proper UX for ModelsForm:
  * Figure out when unique can be applied
  * Validate at least one field server side and client side (don't show)
  * Help texts for data types etc.
  * models.fields field. Remove the model and have it be generated instead - getModel().
    * {name, key, type, validation, relationship}
    * Figure out data types here based on contentful
      https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/data-model
      * Short Text (Single line, length 256)
      * Long Text (Multiline, length 50k)
      * Slug. Can be updated?
      * Integer Number
      * Decimal Number (Float)
      * Boolean (true or false)
      * Enumeration
      * Relationship ()
      * Location
      * JSON
      * Date and time ("2015-11-06T09:45:27" ISO 8601)
      * Asset
    * Support Array Type like contentful does?
    * Need title field indicator like Contentful? Why?
    * Do as much validation as possible in the client
    * Support validations
      Required
      Unique
      Limit character count
      Match pattern
      Accept only specific values
    * Support relationships
    * Unique
    * Required (migration?)
    * Consider the approach of doing the fields transformation in the UI before you go all in and refactor the backend (fairly big change)
    * Use proper models.model.schema validation in the backend instead or before swagger validation

* Account Plans with GraphCMS
  Basic 29 USD per project per month (webhooks)
  Growth 99 USD per project per month (localization)
  Business 349 USD (premium support)

  GraphCMS show length of text inputs
  "Save and Close" and "Save and Publish" buttons
  GraphCMS has Algolia integration
  When your trial expires, you won't have access to the features Webhooks and Localization anymore.
  The Webhooks feature is available on Basic and higher plans.
  The Localization feature is available on Growth and higher plans.

* Account Plans with Contentful
  Developer Edition - 39 USD per month (5 users, 2 spaces, 10k records, 1M requests)
  Team Edition - 249 USD per month (15 users, 3 spaces, 25k records, 3M requests)
  Professional - 949 USD per month (50k records, 6M requests)

  Models List
  Name | Description | Fields | Updated | By

  ModelsEdit
  "displayField": "title",

  Not able to leave organization?

* Cosmic JS
  Starter - 29 USD (3 GB files, 25k requests, 5 users)
  Pro - 99 USD (15 GB files, 150k requests, 10 users)
  Categorize users by "Developer" and "Content Editor"
  All content by default has title/slug/content. Then you can add meta fields in addition.
  On the DataEdit page there is a link to the API endpoint. Very nice!
  There is also a link to a JavaScript code snippet for fetching the content. Awesome.

* Figure out consistent page layout Bootstrap markup

* Generic handling of:
  * status 5xx http responses
  * status 4xx http responses

* API test models CRUD

* Models validation API test

* Consistent form error handling?

* More E2E Tests
  * login_validation.js
  * register_validation.js

## Epics (Major Features)

## Ice Box (For Later Consideration)

* Registration form
  What if you register with an account that already exists
  An invitation request should be emailed to admins of account

* handle console.log in all browsers?

* slug - An autogenerated url-safe and human-readable identifier for an item

* Handle three API types (options.scope={accountId, scopeId}):
  * spaceId scoped: /v1/data/{spaceId}
  * accountId scoped: /v1/{accountId}/models|spaces
  * Global: /v1/users|accounts|login

* Need account and scope selectors
  Pick first for now. Allow settind users.defaultSpaceId on profile page or keep track of last used?

## Forms checklist

* form novalidate ?
* autofocus
* required
* Ajax loader next to submit
* Use proper type (number, email, url, time, date, datetime-local etc.)
* Help texts (x-meta.description):
    <small id="emailHelp" class="form-text text-muted">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</small>
Placeholder:
      <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp" placeholder="Enter email">
Checkbox:
  <div class="form-check">
    <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="exampleCheck1">
    <label class="form-check-label" for="exampleCheck1">Check me out</label>
  </div>
